after an exam i was in a very bad mood as i had done it very       badly.  at home, my mother took so long to ask me how things had  gone that i lost my temper.  i overreacted and made my mother cry. she still prepared lunch for me and did not scold me .  suddenly, i thought that it was my fault and i started crying.
whenever i am alone in a dark room, walk alone on the street, sleep alone in the room at night or see something which is only partly visible.  this emotion was very strong when as an 8 year   old child i saw something horrible.
there was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of mine.  he only thought about his own interest and not about our friendship.  this behaviour hurt his friends.  another incident is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons.
when i was emotionally unstable i said things which may have hurt others or made them feel unhappy.  when i calmed down i realized that i had been selfish and had not taken into consideration the feelings of others.  then i felt ashamed as someone pointed out my behaviour to me.
when i received the letter informing that i had been accepted to be a chinese university student, i was excited as i had longed for it.

after a meeting ended we started talking about when we would have the next discussion ( i had many tests the coming week and could not have a meeting in between, i thought that they would understand this as they had always done).  they did not understand my problem and thought that i should not have so many other activities.  their reaction made me burst into tears.
during an informal discussion i contributed a lot even though i had not spent much time studying.  whenever someone said that someone was not paying attention, or that he had too many other things to do, or that the persoon was not trying his best, i would feel ashamed.

one day i had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and wore it.  he had not had a bath and was very dirty.  i scolded him but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  i was very angry so i starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly and freely.
my boyfriend and i did not have any contact with each other during  the summer holidays.  i met him the day of the registration and looked  through him.  in the canteen he asked me if i wanted to have a drink and  i said no as i did not want him to do me a favour.

my sister once stole my mother's money and made her very angry.  after this my mother would beat her up for unreasonable reasons.  one day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my mother about it.  when my mother learnt this she beat her up and even threatened her with a pair of scissors.
my mother was always fastidious about my room, bed time, etc.  she treated us strictly and punished us physically.   these things were intolerable.

one day i was the leader of the weekly meeting of the church fellowship.  that day i had been preparing for the exams and did not estimate the time to travel to the church right and i was twenty minutes late.  as i had not prepared well i led the meeting badly.  i was ashamed of myself.

when i got into a bus i found that my wallet had been stolen. it was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but i lost some documents - identity papers.  as a result i had to spend several days in order to get a new one.  i will always remember all the work i had to do and the bad treatment i suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil servant.  i had already had bad luck and they treated me like a criminal.   at one point of time i really wanted to quarrel with them.
a few days back, i walked on a heap of faeces while walking on the road.  i got goose flesh because of this.

at noon one sunday i received a phone call telling me that my mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and that her husband should go and see her.  i could not believe this as my father and my mother had gone out together to buy lunch boxes.  however i immediately ran to the scene of the accident.
when i was in lower six class during the summer i joined a research group of the chinese university student union.  i knew a lot of cv students there.  a year later one of them was travelling in mainland china and he got t.b.  he died a few weeks after coming back to h.k.  we all got together for the funeral and when i looked at the body for the last time i felt extremely sad.
when i was in lower six i joined an interview group to interview the general public.  one of my friends in the group lost her purse and she was very nervous.  five of us had to go another place so we left her, and planned to see her later.  then i heard her describing how her purse looked.  i realized that i had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any thing about it.

i suddenly found that those whom i considerered to be my good friends did not care for me.  although i could still be with them i felt unimportant.  i deeply thought about the reason behind this so as to see who was responsible for this.  finally i made up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  i was sad when i decided that they were no longer my good friends.
my teacher reminded us not to do a summer job, however i did it for two months.  yesterday i was chatting with my teacher and when we talked of the summer job, i felt ashamed.
a boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes outside.  i thought that he would reveal what he felt and would question me on our relationship.  i treated him as a friend and did not want any misunderstandings.  therefore i refused to meet him and told him that i would see him the coming day.  i was very unhappy as i feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.

it was a week before the higher level results were announced.  i had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that i was taking the exam.  i knew that if i failed again i woulld have to enter the society.  i imagined things during this period - i dreamt that i had entered university and it was a nice experience.  when i thought about the future, an unexplainable fear rose in me.  i feared being a worker and not having a bright prospect, i also feared the criticism of my relatives as my brother had gone to university.  whenevr i thought of this issue i could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased.

in september 1984, i was forced to live with someone i did not like.  the first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation was like a debate.  the atmosphere was very bad.  when he learnt that i had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" a failure, you lost 5 marks.""   i was very angry, not because my marks were lower than his, but because i could not tolerate his pride.  i did not show my discontentment and carried on doing my work.
my roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had melody but had no content.  we lived together so when he played the recorder i was forced to listen to them.  i could not tell him that i did not like to listen to the songs, as i had no right to disturb the freedom of others.  so i would find a pretext to leave the room and go somewhere else.
