after i had managed to fail my first year at university i was scared as to what i was going to do with my future. i didn't want a mundane 9-5 job and yet i didn't know if i could pay my way through an unsubsidized year at university to settle down and continue my studies.

like guilt - the most ashamed i have ever felt was when i began to feel guilty about having sex with my boyfriend when it was only ""the thing to do"", and not really an act of love.
this feeling of guilt really applies to moral/religious views. i (being catholic) went against what i was brought up to believe in and had a sexual relationship with my boyfriend. many months later, when i was doing some deeper self analysis i began to feel guilty and realized that i had gone against what i wanted for myself and my future.
my mother along with some of my friends gave me a surprise birthday party - they invited a large number of my friends along too.

with the n.z. rugby union wanting to send the all blacks to south africa.
that my brother and father are into alcohol, two men with priviledge. not using it positively.
when i betrayed my lover, she told me something in confidence, i felt at the time i had to relay the information back to the person concerned, as i felt the situation volitile, did this without telling my lover, she felt like piggy in the middle, as she was not directly concerned. maybe you could call it gossip i felt different after i had slept on it. if i had waited, thought, now i would not have done it.
a good friend, the wife of the vicar of my church came up to me from the pews (i am in the choir) and shook my hand during the time for an informal ""greeting"" in the church service. she said a few words.

my friend replying to my letter and again saying he was attracted to me and suggesting we write, talk and get together and see how things went and his suggestion that i could ring and doing that it was really good - though really insane conversation.
being sexually assaulted (not rape, but passionate kissing) by a friend's father - he stopped when he was driving me home. i hadn't wanted the lift, had refused 3 times, and then felt it'd be rude to refuse again. was really afraid of what he might do.
i live by myself and a few weeks ago was woke by a man on the end of my bed coming up my bed at me. i was really angry, told him to get out. he was surprised, hesitated; i started to move towards him and he backed off - kept telling him - loudly, but firmly to go. because i'd got the initiative, i succeeded. a very powerful message.
when my grandmother died - i wasn't sad so much that she'd died because she was old, but because she lived in the last few years in an old people's home and had nothing very much that was hers - no chair, or private space, and when i went to visit she would be sitting in the ""lliving"" room the tv room. it was hopeless. and i felt awkward so i didn't go and i was sad 'cos how i couldn't.

when i heard the news of the death of my father.  it was in the evening and i was alone all night in my room trying to remember the face of my father.
one day my colleague misbehaved with me.  i felt disgusted and thought to myself that he could only do this because i was a woman.
one day i addressed my husband in an abusive manner in front of his friends.  later on i realized this myself and felt ashamed of myself.

when the results of the part i exams came out i felt tremendous joy in my heart.  the results came out after a long period of worry and anxiety, so it gave me endless relief and joy.
i felt afraid just before receiving the question paper of the part ii exam.
i remember that when i was in school i saw a case of partiality - one of the teachers gave private coaching classes to some girls and she would give these girls extra attention in class and would ignore the others.
on the last day of my school life i was very sad, specially on the farewell party day.  i felt sad to leave behind my beloved teachers and friends.
i was most disgusted when i had to make a nagging three day journey recently from calcutta to bombay.  it was very boring and tiring.
i remember that once, a friend did not co-operate with me due to some unavoidable reasons.  unaware of this i treated her unjustly till i realized everything, and then i felt ashamad of my deeds.

when an event took place in another's life and which i thought i could have avoided.
the day i was happiest was the day when i received a phone call from eve's weekly to inform me that i had won the first prize of the all india essay competition.  i had won this prize when i was an under-graduate when even post graduates had participated.  i had been judged by eminent judges and political scientists.
fear is an emotion that i experience very often.  naturally this is during exams and subsequently while waiting for the results.  however there is one occassion when i was paralyzed with fear.  this was when i was doing my m.a.-i, and we had a series of student lectures.  i was one of the participants and my lecture happened to be the opening lecture.  i had been confident all morning, about twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing me.  i felt my heart go cold, my lips go dry and i was really paralyzed.  this incident of fear is still fresh.
i experience this emotion quite often but the day i was most angry was the day i got pulled up for something i had not done.  it happened during my school days, i had not spoken a word in class but the monitor had written my name on the board.  so i had a remark in my callender which i had to get signed by my parents.  this remark resulted in me being spanked.
i have once been very sad and lonely.  this was when i was trying to organize a play as a student (15 years).  instead of materializing, it fizzled out.  the worst thing was that the play fell apart completely and i found myself weeping uncontrollably.  now when i think of it, i laugh it off; but at that time it was intense.
this is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life in a city like bombay.  one day i was travelling by bus, three men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  once outside they were beaten into pulp.  these two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  i thought to myself -""what is life?"".  it is one hell of a place where everyone is after someone else.  one waits to cut the throat of the other one just for a living, (money).  when i think about such things - the purpose of life, etc, i feel very disgusted and dejected.
this is an event i will never forget.  i am considered a good mimic.  this particular day we were waiting for a professor to take her class.  this  professor had a peculiar accent and a very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this class at the fag end of the day.  so this particular day i got into my element and started imitating the professor, and the professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  i was unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but it was of no avail as i was too engrossed in mimicing.  then i suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her entering the class.  i do not know till today if she actually saw what i had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  through  out that lecture i died of shame.  all the more shameful was the fact that she gave me a character certificate.
this happened when it was finally confirmed that i had stood first in the university for the m.a exams.  a few days before the official results were declared a clerk had brought the results unofficially.  so i had been expecting the results but the confirmation allowed me to legitimately feel happy at my success.
this was when i was being followed home every day from the campus, by a stranger.  he would follow me to the campus and then sit outside my class.  if i was not there he would ask my friends as to where i was.  he was a dark, ominous looking person and i was terrified of him as i did not know his intentions.  i reported him to the security officer, who turned him over to the police.  i was even more petrified then.
a new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came to do it was very rude to my mother and me.  i rushed to thhe dealer with my mother and had a fight with the dealer as he seemed to be unreasonable and was taking the mechanic's side.  ultimately the matter was resolved after my father went and spoke to him.  the mechanic was asked to apologize.
the day i was to receive my gold-medal for the m.a, my grandmother, who i loved very much, died after an illness.  she  died a few hours before the convocation.  while i was attending the convocation i had to control my grief as she would not have liked me to miss it.  it was a day she had been waiting for, but did not get to see.
we had come back from a programme and we were all (three girls)    staying over at another girls placce.  one of them started passing very nasty and outright bitchy remarks at me.  it was brought on by a male colleague's compliments to me, this girl was herself interested in this guy.  bitchiness and catty remarks made by women never fail to disgust me.  i can particularly remember this incident as she knew that i had not encouraged the  guy.
i was learning judo and my instructor wanted me to assist him in teaching girls judo at a suburban college.  i was just a beginer, and he made me a green belt so that i would be able to command respect.  this was against my principles, and yet i allowed myself to listen to him.  i gave it up soon after, however i felt very ashamed at not sticking to my principles and at not having put my foot down earlier.
i was coming back home with my mother when the purse i was carrying got stolen.  it was done so swifty that i did not realize what had happened till much later.  a lot of money and the keys of the house were lost.  i was guilt ridden at my carelessness.  i felt terrible as i do not normally loose things and this was quite important, especially the keys.

i read about the national and social spirit and self-discipline of the people of developed coutries like u.s.a, england, france, germany etc.  comparing this to the indian people i felt guilty as they have no national spirit or self-discipline.
i felt happy at the settlement of our marriage, even though we are from different socio-linguistic backgrounds our parents agreed to the wedding without any conflict or discussion.  we had  thought that they would object to the wedding but it did not happen.
one day, early morning my mother who is healthy fell ill.  there was no doctor or compounder near by and for a few hours -8 a.m to 6 p.m she did not speak a single sentence, nor did she drink water or  milk.  there was no movement in her body and i felt really scared.  i almost lost my confidence about her survival.
one day my elder brother badly scolded my father.  this was the first time that i heard such abusive language from my brother.  i requested him humbly not to use this kind of language but he did not care for what i was saying.  finally i picked up an axe to use against him, in the meanwhile people intervened.
my close friend and i applied to tiss for admission last year, unfortunately he failed to get admission.  we had done our graduation together and are quite involved with each other, so we had wanted to do our masters degree together.  however, it did not work out as we had expected it to and this saddened me.
my classmate at tiss has the habit of biting his nails and ever since my childhood i have never liked this habit.  this person is near me in class, dining hall and the campus so i suggested that he should stop biting his nails.  however he found it difficult and my disgust feelings have not changed.
i had this feeling before my graduation and never dared to speak to my relatives and  friends.  because of this feeling i would avoid situations, however i do not know the reason for this.

i was travelling from delhi to bombay.  i had booked a seat one month back and i had also got a telegram confirming this.  however, in the train my name had been omitted from the reservation sheet, and the one seat that was still vacant was alloted to another person who paid for it despite my requests for the seat.  i was allowed to stay in the reserved compartment when i paid money.
